5. ✅ **Game Phase Breakdown** - Early/mid/late game analysis organization
6. ✅ **Missed Opportunity Detection** - High-impact plays identification
7. ✅ **Gamified Feedback System** - Achievement-based coaching with progression tracking

## 🏗️ Architecture Integration

The system integrates with your existing components:

```
Existing System:
├── TemporalPipeline (✅ Your implementation)
├── EventDetector (✅ Your implementation)
├── BehavioralModeling (✅ Your implementation)
├── AdvancedPerformanceAnalyzer (✅ Your implementation)
└── BaseService Architecture (✅ Your implementation)

New Components:
├── TacticalCoachingService (🆕 New service)
├── TacticalAnalysisEngine (🆕 Core analysis logic)
├── TacticalCoachingAPI (🆕 REST endpoints)
└── ComprehensiveTestSuite (🆕 Demo system)
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Input: Timestamped JSON Data

The system ingests temporal analysis data from your existing pipeline:

```json
{
  "video_analysis": {
    "player_ign": "Lesz XVII",
    "video_path": "gameplay.mp4",
    "total_duration": 720.5
  },
  "timestamped_events": [
    {
      "timestamp": 245.5,
      "event_type": "movement_event",
      "event_subtype": "rotation",
      "player": "Lesz XVII",
      "from_region": "mid_lane",
      "to_region": "bot_lane",
      "metadata": {
        "frame_path": "frame_007365_t245.50s.jpg"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output: Comprehensive Coaching Report

The system generates structured tactical coaching:

```json
{
  "post_game_summary": "Critical tactical issues identified (1). Focus on fundamental decision-making and risk management. Your carry-focused approach demonstrates strong mechanical skills. Think of MLBB like chess - every move should consider the next 2-3 moves...",

  "tactical_findings": [
    {
      "timestamp": 320.1,
      "event": "death_overextension",
      "finding": "Death due to overextension in enemy_jungle at 320.1s. High-risk positioning without vision coverage.",
      "suggestion": "Maintain vision control and communicate with team before extending to high-risk areas like enemy jungle.",
      "severity": "critical",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "game_phase": "early_game"
    }
  ],

  "visual_overlays": [
    {
      "frame_path": "frame_017706_t590.20s.jpg",
      "annotations": [
        {
          "type": "zone",
          "region": "danger_zone",
          "label": "High Risk Position",
          "color": "red"
        },
        {
          "type": "arrow",
          "from_region": "current_position",
          "to_region": "safe_position",
          "label": "Suggested Position",
          "color": "green"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],

  "opportunity_analysis": [
    {
      "timestamp": 512.3,
      "event": "tower_destroyed",
      "missed_action": "Not present for tower push after favorable team fight",
      "alternative": "Rotate to tower immediately after team fight advantage at 497.3s",
      "impact_score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "Tower gold and map control are crucial for maintaining momentum"
    }
  ],

  "gamified_feedback": [
    "🎯 Positioning Apprentice: One positioning issue identified – you're improving but stay vigilant!",
    "🚀 Rotation Expert: Perfect rotation timing – excellent macro awareness and map control!",
    "🎊 Consistent Performer: Few major tactical issues identified – maintain this level of gameplay excellence!"
  ]
}
```
