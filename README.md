# MLBB Coach AI

**Intelligent Coaching System for Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Players**

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

MLBB Coach AI is an advanced AI-powered coaching tool that analyzes Mobile Legends: Bang Bang match statistics and provides actionable, role-specific feedback. Built with sophisticated evaluation logic and dynamic thresholds, it simulates what a professional coach would tell you—based on real performance data and game knowledge.

## ⚡ Key Features

- **🎮 Role-Specific Analysis** - Tailored evaluation for all 6 MLBB roles (Marksman, Assassin, Mage, Tank, Support, Fighter)
- **⏱️ Dynamic Scaling** - Performance thresholds adjust based on match duration
- **🎯 Severity Levels** - Prioritized feedback (Critical → Warning → Info → Success)
- **📊 Comprehensive Metrics** - KDA, GPM, damage ratios, positioning, teamfight participation
- **⚙️ Configurable Thresholds** - YAML-based configuration for easy tuning
- **🧪 Battle-Tested** - Comprehensive unit testing and validation

## 🚀 What Makes It Advanced

### Smart Evaluation Engine

- **Match Duration Scaling**: 10-minute games have different expectations than 25-minute games
- **Context-Aware Feedback**: "Your 65,000 damage in 17 minutes is below the 63,750 threshold"
- **Neutral Feedback**: Always provides context, even for average performance

### Sophisticated Architecture

- **BaseEvaluator Pattern**: Shared logic with hero-specific overrides
- **Configuration-Driven**: No hardcoded thresholds—everything in YAML
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for reliability

## 🤖 Tech Stack

**Current Implementation:**

- **Python 3.x** with type hints
- **YAML** for configuration management
- **Dynamic imports** for modular hero evaluation
- **Inheritance patterns** for code reuse
- **Unit testing** for reliability

**Planned Enhancements:**

- **Web Interface** (React + Tailwind + GSAP)
- **ML Integration** (scikit-learn, pandas)
- **API Integration** (MLBB official data sources)

## 📊 Example Output

```bash
🧠 Match 1 Coaching Report (Hero: Chou)
- warning: KDA 2.4 (< 3.0). Pick safer angles and exit with 2nd skill.
- warning: GPM 580 (< 650). Clear side waves between ganks.
- warning: Low fight presence (58% < 60%). Collapse faster on ally engages.
- critical: 7 deaths is too high. Chou has great mobility—use Shunpo to disengage after combos.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Example

```yaml
# config/thresholds.yml
heroes:
  chou:
    damage_base: 3750 # Slightly lower than generic fighter
    teamfight_participation: 60

roles:
  fighter:
    kda:
      low: 3.0
      high: 5.0
    gpm_base: 650
```

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python tests/test_chou.py

✓ test_kda_low passed
✓ test_damage_scaling passed
✓ test_severity_levels passed
✅ All tests passed!
```

## 📌 Current Status

- ✅ **Production-Ready Core** - Advanced evaluation engine with dynamic thresholds
- ✅ **6 Hero Implementations** - Complete coverage of major MLBB roles
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests prevent regressions
- ✅ **Professional Architecture** - Inheritance, configuration, modularity
- 🔜 **Next Phase**: Web UI and ML integration

## 🧠 About the Developer

Built by **Rhine (Les)** - a 400+ star Mythical-ranked MLBB player combining deep game knowledge with software engineering expertise. This project demonstrates advanced Python architecture while solving real gameplay improvement challenges.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Traditional MLBB tools provide raw statistics without context. This system provides **intelligent coaching**:

- **Context-Aware**: "Your 580 GPM in a 17-minute game needs improvement"
- **Actionable**: "Use Shunpo to disengage after combos"
- **Prioritized**: Critical issues highlighted first
- **Role-Specific**: Marksman advice differs from Tank strategies
