## Target: {target}

### Description
{description}

### Collection Instructions
1. **Play matches** where you get MVP but your team loses
2. **After each match**: Screenshot BOTH views
3. **Damage view**: Save to `damage_view/` folder
4. **KDA view**: Save to `kda_view/` folder

### File Naming Convention
- **Damage**: `{match_type.lower()}_mvp_loss_performance_match01_damage.jpg`
- **KDA**: `{match_type.lower()}_mvp_loss_performance_match01_kda.jpg`

### What to Look For
- **MVP Badge**: Silver MVP badge (losing team MVP)
- **High KDA**: Usually 8+ kills, low deaths
- **High Damage**: Top damage on your team
- **Team Defeat**: Red "DEFEAT" screen despite your excellent performance

### Criteria
- Individual performance: Excellent (MVP-worthy)
- Team outcome: Loss/Defeat
- Badge type: Silver MVP badge (not gold)
- Your stats: Top performer on losing team

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Match 1: _____ (Hero: ______, KDA: ______, MVP: Yes/No)
- [ ] Match 2: _____ (Hero: ______, KDA: ______, MVP: Yes/No)
- [ ] Match 3: _____ (Hero: ______, KDA: ______, MVP: Yes/No)
- [ ] Match 4: _____ (Hero: ______, KDA: ______, MVP: Yes/No)

### Notes
- These matches are rare but valuable for training
- Focus on clear MVP badge visibility in screenshots
- Capture both the defeat screen AND MVP recognition
- Document if MVP badge is silver vs gold

## What is MVP Loss?
- You get the **MVP badge** (silver, not gold)
- Your team **loses the match** (red DEFEAT screen)
- Your individual performance was **excellent** despite the loss

## How to Identify MVP Loss Matches
1. **During Match**: Play your best, even if team is losing
2. **Post-Match**: Look for:
   - ‚ùå Red "DEFEAT" screen
   - ü•à Silver MVP badge on your hero
   - üìä Top stats on your team (damage, KDA, etc.)

## Screenshot Workflow
1. **Wait** for post-match screen to fully load
2. **Screenshot 1**: Damage view (shows defeat + MVP badge)
3. **Tap "Data"**: Switch to KDA/Items view  
4. **Screenshot 2**: KDA view (shows stats + MVP badge)

## File Organization
```

```

## Target Collection
- **Ranked**: 4 matches (8 images)
- **Classic**: 4 matches (8 images)  
- **Other**: 2 matches (4 images)
- **Total**: 10 matches (20 images)

## Tips for Finding MVP Loss Matches
- **Solo queue ranked**: Higher chance of team coordination issues
- **Play carry roles**: Marksman, Mage, Assassin more likely to get MVP
- **Late game heroes**: Heroes that scale can carry despite early disadvantage
- **Don't give up**: Even in losing matches, play for individual performance

## What Makes Good MVP Loss Screenshots
‚úÖ Clear silver MVP badge visible
‚úÖ Red DEFEAT text clearly shown
‚úÖ Your stats are highlighted/prominent
‚úÖ Both damage and KDA views captured
‚úÖ High quality, readable UI elements

‚ùå Blurry or cut-off MVP badge
‚ùå Unclear defeat indication
‚ùå Missing individual stat highlights
‚ùå Poor image quality

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] MVP badge clearly visible (silver)
- [ ] Defeat screen clearly shown (red)
- [ ] Your hero is highlighted as MVP
- [ ] Both views captured (damage + KDA)
- [ ] Files named correctly
- [ ] Progress updated in README
