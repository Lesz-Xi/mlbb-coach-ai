# 🥈 MVP Loss Collection Guide

## What is MVP Loss?
- You get the **MVP badge** (silver, not gold)
- Your team **loses the match** (red DEFEAT screen)
- Your individual performance was **excellent** despite the loss

## How to Identify MVP Loss Matches
1. **During Match**: Play your best, even if team is losing
2. **Post-Match**: Look for:
   - ❌ Red "DEFEAT" screen
   - 🥈 Silver MVP badge on your hero
   - 📊 Top stats on your team (damage, KDA, etc.)

## Screenshot Workflow
1. **Wait** for post-match screen to fully load
2. **Screenshot 1**: Damage view (shows defeat + MVP badge)
3. **Tap "Data"**: Switch to KDA/Items view  
4. **Screenshot 2**: KDA view (shows stats + MVP badge)
