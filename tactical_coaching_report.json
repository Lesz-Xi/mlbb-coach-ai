Consider balancing individual excellence with team coordination. Analysis detected 1 missed opportunities for greater impact. Focus on maintaining momentum after advantages. Think of MLBB like chess - every move should consider the next 2-3 moves. Your tactical awareness is developing well, but remember: positioning is like protecting your king, and rotations are like controlling the center. Primary focus areas: positioning safety, map awareness, and objective timing coordination.",
